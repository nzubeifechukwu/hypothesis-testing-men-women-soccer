# Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches

In this project, I apply my statistical testing skills to historical data of men's and women's international soccer matches. Specifically, I perform a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?

## Acknowledgement

The idea and dataset for this project are from [this DataCamp project](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/hypothesis_testing_with_mens_and_womens_soccer_matches/guided/Python).
